# Synthex

A signal synthesis library. Currently implements basic oscillators and a few filters. Output to WAV file and direct audio output (requires SoX) are supported.

## Installation

The package can be installed as:

  1. Add synthex to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:
```elixir
  def deps do
    [{:synthex, "~> 0.0.1"}]
  end
```

  2. Ensure synthex is started before your application:
```elixir
  def application do
    [applications: [:synthex]]
  end
```

## How to use

Please take a look at the examples to see how to use it. Development is at a very early stage now, so things may change and break between releases

## TODO
* More filters (FIR) - coming soon
* Tests
* Documentation
